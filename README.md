## React Native Coding Challenge

## Overview
To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple React Native based app, and provide us the source files.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your coding, organizational, naming, and structural skills as well as your approach to composing a simple app given a set of screens and a REST API.

This challenge is expected to take about 2-4 hours. Please do not spend any more time on it than that.

## The Challenge
It's pretty simple. Using the provided screens as a reference, you'll need to build a set of components to render the app. You'll also need to request a JSON resource. Although this is a basic exercise, we'll be looking for simple, well-designed, performant, organized, and tested code in the submission.

## Details
You will need to build the following screens:

A "Home" screen<br />
An "Albums" screen<br />
An "Album" screen

##### Home
Refer to the screens/home.jpg screen. Show a list of "liked" albums.

##### Albums
Refer to the screens/albums.jpg screen. The user should be able to like or dislike an album.

##### Album
Refer to the screens/album.jpg screen. The user should be able to read some text about the album.

You can fetch JSON resources from here [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). You'll have to replace the album images with images of your choice. We have used [Place Kitten](https://placekitten.com) in our example and you are welcome to use it too.

You will also need to handle the loading and error states of fetching the JSON resources. How you do that is up to you.

## Additional Requirements
Please include a README with setup instructions, and any tests or other documentation you created as part of your solution.

Add the following info to your README:

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

One last thingâ€“We prefer it if you did not use any third party CSS frameworks and keep your dependencies to a minimum.

## FAQ
- What language, framework, build tool, etc should I use?<br />
You may use whatever you like as long as the solution is built using React Native.
